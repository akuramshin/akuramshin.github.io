title: "Vehicle Detection and Motion Forecasting"
collection: projects
description: 'Models for vehicle detection and motion forecasting on the PandaSet dataset. Implemented preprocessing by creating BEV voxelized images from LiDAR data. Developed a heat-map object detection model using focal loss and anisotropic gaussians. Built a model that predicts a parametric distribution over future trajectories.'
