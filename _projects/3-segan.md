title: "Hand Drawing Generative Model"
collection: projects
description: "Wrote a mock NeurIPS paper as a final group project. The project focused on using the GAN architecture for audio synthesis. For this paper, my group and I examined the performance of the vanilla Speech Enhancement GAN against variations that include the Departure From Normality (DFN) metric and Wasserstein loss (WSEGAN)."
