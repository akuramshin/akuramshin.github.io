description: 'I worked at [Sanctuary AI](https://www.sanctuary.ai/) as a Software Co-op on the Machine Learning team. Summer 2022 I worked on object grasping and manipulation using a multi-fingered robotic hand. I implemented a pipeline that would generate and evaluate possible grasps for known objects. Summer 2023 I designed and developed a real-world SLAM data collection and annotation pipeline.'
