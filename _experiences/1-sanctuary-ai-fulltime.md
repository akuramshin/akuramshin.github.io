description: 'In March 2024 I returned to [Sanctuary AI](https://www.sanctuary.ai/) as a Junior DataOps Engineer. During my time there, I develop and maintained pipelines for capturing and processing robotic teleoperated data in both simulation and real for downstream machine learning model training. Additionally, I worked closely with ML engineers on training automation in the MLOps platform ClearML.'
