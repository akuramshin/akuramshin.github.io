description: 'I was a research assistant intern at the [RVL Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/#/) supervised by [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/). We worked on stochastic planning for autonomous surface vessel (ASV) navigation using satelite images. I helped design a software stack that supported communication between ROS, the web front-end visualization, and the Gazebo simulation or real-world.'
